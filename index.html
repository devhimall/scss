          Explaining the rem and rem different through a story
        </p>
        <p class="assignment1__paragraph1">
          Imagine a magical kingdom called Webland, where everything revolves
          around the Royal Font Family. The kingdom has two young siblings, Rem
          and Em, who are responsible for setting the sizes of the kingdom's
          fonts, objects, and spaces. Their father, the Root King, sets the
          standards for the kingdom, so everyone looks to him for guidance on
          size and scale. Here’s how the story goes:
        </p>
        <h2>The Root King and His Wise Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          In Webland, The Root King rules the land. The Root King has an
          impressive decree: he decides the "base font size" for the entire
          kingdom. He declares, "The kingdom shall have a base font size of 16
          pixels." This decree is passed down to all the citizens of Webland, so
          everyone knows the standard size.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Rem, the king’s decision is sacred. "I will always honor Father’s
          standard," says Rem. “No matter where I go in Webland, I’ll always use
          Father’s base font size as my measure.”
        </p>
        <h2>The Adventures of Rem</h2>
        <p>
          Rem is a loyal child. Wherever Rem goes, they always measure things
          according to the Root King's rule. If Rem wants to make something
          twice as big as the base size, they declare, “This shall be 2 rem,”
          which is 2 times 16 pixels, or 32 pixels. If they need something half
          as big, they say, “This will be 0.5 rem,” which is 0.5 times 16
          pixels, or 8 pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rem’s adherence to the Root King’s decree is unwavering. No matter
          where Rem travels in the kingdom, from the smallest village to the
          grandest castle, 1 rem is always 16 pixels.
        </p>
        <h2>Em and the Ever-Changing Standards</h2>
        <p>
          Rem’s sibling Em, on the other hand, is more of a free spirit. Em
          loves to adapt and fit into whatever environment they’re in. “I’ll
          adjust my size based on wherever I find myself,” Em declares. Em
          doesn’t only follow the Root King; Em follows the immediate
          family—whatever parent element they are nested within. <br />
          <strong>For example: </strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="assignments__lists">
          <li>
            If Em is in the Root King’s castle, they measure things based on the
            Root King’s size (16 pixels).
          </li>
          <li>
            But if Em visits Auntie Header who likes to be a little bigger and
            sets her own font size at 24 pixels, Em adapts. For Em, 1 em will be
            24 pixels while they’re in Auntie Header’s house.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This means Em’s size changes depending on where they are, like a
          shape-shifter! If Em needs something 1.5 times as big, they’ll say,
          “This will be 1.5 em.” In Auntie Header’s house, that’s 1.5 times 24
          pixels (or 36 pixels). In the Root King’s castle, it’s only 1.5 times
          16 pixels (or 24 pixels).
